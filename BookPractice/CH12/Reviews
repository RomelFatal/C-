// Program that reads business reviews from a file and computes the average rating.
/* The following example reads a file with business reviews as the program starts and 
* outputs data from the file at the end of the program. 
* The number of reviews is unknown to the program, so the program continues to read until the end of the file. 
* Each entry contains the username of the person who left the review and a 1 - 5 rating 
* (1 being a low rating and 5 being a high rating). 
* Upon completion, the program outputs the data from the file along with the average business rating.
